# PersonClassification
Person classification is a supervised learning problem that uses classification algorithm : define a set of target classes (objects to identify in images), and train a model to recognize them using labelled example photos The main motto of the project is to build a website where user can drop
an image of the person and the website will provide the details of the person as to which person in
trained data it is matching and with how much accuracy in percentage. Project is restricted to only
5 classes which means to provide only any 5 persons whose details will be extracted in drop by
user. In this study, image detection technology edge detection, grayscale processing, object
capture, target recognition, etc are combined with the actual needs of persons to achieve a variety
of needs for person image detection.
Person classification is the process of categorizing and labeling groups of pixels or vectors within
an image based on specific rules. It particularily focuses on 2 eyes of a person and recognise the
person ,if person image doesnâ€™t contain 2 eyes clearly visible it will discord.

SUMMARY:

This project centers around the development of a image classification system through the
application of machine learning techniques.The project encompasses data collection,
preprocessing, and the creation of a robust model, often based on Logistic Regression model, to
learn intricate patterns and features within images. The culmination of the project involves
comprehensive model evaluation, testing on unseen data, and the potential deployment of the
trained system for real- world scenarios. By harnessing the power of image classification through
machine learning, this project offers a versatile solution with potential impacts for celebrity images
classification.
